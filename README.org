** The Hoare State Monad

The Hoare State Monad is a way of encoding the preconditions and postconditions of Hoare Logic in the type of the familiar state monad from Haskell.

This repository contains an exploration of the Hoare State Monad using Coq.

The code in ~hoare_state.v~ is reproduced from the paper ~Hoare State Monad Proof Pearl~ by Wouter Swiestra available here https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~swier004/publications/2009-tphols.pdf.
